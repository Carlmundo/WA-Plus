# Worms Armageddon Plus
An easy to install patch to modernise the game and unlock more content.

This has been tested on the following versions of Worms Armageddon
 - 3.8 (Steam, CD version)

## Install
[Download the latest version](https://github.com/Carlmundo/WA-Plus/releases/latest)

## Features

### Mods
 - Higher resolution menus (via [SuperFrontendHD](https://worms2d.info/SuperFrontendHD))
 - Host without port forwarding (via [WormNAT2](https://worms2d.info/WormNAT2))

This prevents issues with the game crashing, switching windows and hosting games.

### Unlocks
 - All Weapons, inlcuding Super weapons and "The Full Wormage" weapon scheme.
 - Game Options:
 	- Blood Mode
 	- Sheep Heaven (all crates contain sheep)
 	- God Worms
 	- Indestructable Terrain
 - Set ammo count for Utilities (Jet Pack, Laser Sight, etc)
 - Powered up weapons:
 	- Grenade
 	- Longbow
 	- Shotgun 
 	- Banana Bombs can now become Super Banana Bombs 
 	- Super Sheep can now become Aqua Sheep
 - Extended / RubberWorm options (click the star icon next to the game options button)

These features could also be unlocked by achieving progress and gold medals in single player. The patch will backup your existing "Teams" file (\User\Teams\WG.WGT) and use a new file in order to unlock the content. You can find your backup in the \User\Teams folder.

### Additional Maps from Worms World Party
Adds the following maps that were selectable in the semi-sequel:
 - 10 Forts mode maps*
 - Back And Forth
 - Fruit Bastilles
 - Good Ship Armageddon
 - I Rule The Rooster
 - Jumble Sail
 - Radical Rescue
 - Rainforest Ruckus
 - Steeple Jack
 - Take Out The Trash
 - Windymill On High

To use these maps when creating a game:

2. Right click the map to load the Editor.
3. Click the drop down and select your desired map.
4. Click Exit.

*To create a Forts style match, you will need to use a scheme that requires Worms to be manually placed.
