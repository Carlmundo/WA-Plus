WormNAT2: A Worms Armageddon hosting proxy module


Description
-----------

WormNAT2 hooks up W:A with a reverse proxy. Essentially,
it hosts games on the proxy server, and the proxy routes
data between the joining players and the host. The proxy
itself is currently hosted on a dedicated server in Paris,
France.

The preferred way of hosting game is to make your PC
connectable from the Internet. You can find a detailed
guide on how to set up hosting here:
